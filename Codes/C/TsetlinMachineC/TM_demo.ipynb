    "The global aim of this project is to complete a functional Tsetlin Machine accelerator design implemented on PYNQ-Z1 FPGA board. For a typical classification task, the binary testing data should be transmitted into the ZYNQ-Z1, and the result of the class should be outputted back to user with the performance data (throughput, latency and power, etc) measured.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **RTL Synthesis and implementation of Tsetlin Machine**: Initiate the Verilog design of Tsetlin Machine algorithm, construct and package the functional TM module. Finish the regional test with simple datasets (such as XOR).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interconnection design and Circuits Simulation**: Apply interconnection wiring between the PYNQ-Z1 Processor Module, Tsetlin Machine IP and peripheral IO modules. Finish the first stage simulation and generate the sequential waves.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Board level verification and Performance Analysis**: Base on the Tsetlin Machine Module design and interconnection modules, set the constraint file (.xdc) as well as the Verilog source file. Generate bitstream file and program the PYNQ-Z1 board. Measure and analyze the performance using monitoring software (eg.Xilinx Vivado).\n",

Compared to the original design, the refined TsetlinMachineC codes could print the accuracy during training process more conveniently, and it could generate the exclude_state table of the highest-accuracy epoch in txt form. I have posted all my refined codes in my Github repo: https://github.com/Ziyu-Tian/Codes/tree/main/Codes/C/TsetlinMachineC."
